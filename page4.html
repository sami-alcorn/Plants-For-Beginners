            <h4>Bright Light</h4>
            <p>The best locations for plants that enjoy bright, direct sunlight, are in front of a south
            or west facing window. This type of light can burn the leaves of plants that originate from less sunny
            regions of the world, so it's important to monitor your plants in very bright locations for scorched leaves.
            If your house doesn't offer a lot of bright sunlight, there are several types of grow lights available for 
            purchase, so no matter what the natural lighting situation in your home, you can still grow just about an 
            plant you desire. Some plants that love light are succulents and cacti, crotons, most palm varieties, and the fiddle leaf fig.</p>

            <h4>Medium Light</h4>
            <p>Placements for plants that do well in medium light are in front of an east facing window or near a west facing window. 
            The vast majority of indoor houseplants are native to rainforests. Having come from rainforest floors where much of the 
            sunlight is filtered by the tree canopy, means they have not evolved to withstand harsh direct sunlight. We want to do our
            best to emulate those conditions when growing them indoors. As previously stated, countless popular house plant varieties fall
            into this category, but some of the most common are monstera, syngonium, pothos, diffenbachia, philodendron, and orchid.</p>

            <h4>Low Light</h4>
            <p>If you have plants that prefer low light conditions and want them by a window, a north facing one is ideal. Some species of plants 
            simply cannot withstand bright light, while others are hardy, adaptable, and are able to make the best of their situation. Many of
            us have limited sunlight in our home, or are looking to add some natural beauty to a small enclosed space such as a bathroom. If this 
            sounds familiar and you are not interested in buying grow lights for your plants, then it's recommended you get plants that don't 
            require lots of light. A few that thrive in low light are the snake plant, peace lily, calathea, ZZ plant, and peperomia.</p>

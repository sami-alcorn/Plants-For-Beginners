Plants For Beginners utilizes HTML and Bootstrap.
Color hex codes used: #118291, #d4efbd

Two of my favorite features are the "at-a-glance" table and the newsletter sign up form on the homepage. I initially struggled with styling the table but I'm pleased with how it came out. It's responsive, with a scrolling feature at the smallest breakpoint. I am also happy with the navigation bar. 

Code outlining the navbar, not including the links:
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-dark" style=background-color:#118291;">
        <a class="navbar-brand" style="color: #d4efbd; href="index.html">Houseplants 101</a>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" 
        data-target="#navbarNavDropdown" aria-controls="navbarNavDropdown" 
        aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNavDropdown">
        <ul class="navbar-nav"></ul>

All that's needed to run this project is a code editor with Bootstrap installed.
